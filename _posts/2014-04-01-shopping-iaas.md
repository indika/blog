Programs are written, not configured. Infrastructure is configured, not written. While both is a means to construct, the one is more fine grained, and the other is more immutable. There are many different solutions within this grey.

First, there was, CFEngine.

Chef is developed by Opscode, initially developed by Adam Jacob. Initially it was written purely in Ruby, but a year ago since Chef 11, the core was re-written in Erlang, and called ErChef. Erlang is a good language to handle scalability issues. It has been criticized for not having a good web UI. The biggest user of Chef is Facebook.

Puppet is developed by Puppet Labs, initially by Luke Kanies. It is about 9 years old since inception. It too is written in Ruby. It has some big players behind it. Initially it offered a simple DSL to write the configuration, and now the configurations can be written in Ruby as well.

The basic idea is that the agent node sniffs out the configuration on the target node, and sends this information back to the master, which then decides what to do.

Both Chef and Puppet have been funded between $30-40mil. Google, Cisco System and VMWare, amongst others have backed Puppet. With the extra money, both have started to provision Windows based machines.

VMWare has backed Puppet, but both can integrate with VMWare products. Puppet and Chef have support for a variety of hardware.

Boxen is a toolchain built to provision Mac's, and it uses Puppet. It has been criticized that it uses non-default homebrew locations.

Salt and Ansible exist. Both are written in Python.

Salt configurations are written in YAML, and the execution is imperative, and not declarative. I'm postulation that the advantage is that you have fine "grain" control. Resolves some issue about orchestration.

Ansible is a lot more lightweigtht. Ansible remotely copies and executes generated Python scripts directly on the managed instances using SSH. Therefore, the only requirements for managing instances with Ansible are Python and SSH.

OpenStack is an IaaS, with the mission of enabling any organisation to create and offer cloud computing services running on standard hardware. This project was founded by Rackspace and NASA in 2010. It is a cloud operating system - meaning that you can set up a cloud, and not an OS that runs on your hardware that is thin. OpenStack is written in Python. The dashboard is written in Django.

OpenShift can sit on top of OpenStack nicely, and is written in Ruby. The well connected of the two, can help magical autoscaling.

CloudForms sits on top of both of these, and help manage heterogenous cloud architectures. This solution feels less flexible, but it is a turn-key one. OpenShift over OpenStack is advocated by RedHat.
